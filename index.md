Welcome to my personal corner on the Internet!

I'm a reinventor of wheels. It's pretty hard for me to use something and not knowing how it's
actually working. So it's my obsession to reinvent small things even if this doesn't have any
practical use. But I'm also lazy.

Main areas of my interest include:

- **embedded** - AVR, PIC, ARM, Raspberry Pi
- **electronics** - especially related to audio - mixers, amplifiers, synths etc.
- **low-level programming** - inner workings of operating systems and computer hardware
- **game development** - I'm mostly into 2D. Currently my games are pretty dumb
- **retro hardware and software** - especially old game consoles like (S)NES and Gameboy
- **emulators** - retro consoles, CPUs, old computers etc.

I'm also into these things:

- **music production** - mainly electro industrial (in the future, you'll be able to hear some
    of my stuff here - I'll probably link to a bandcamp page)
- **art** - although I do this quite rarely, it helps to clear my mind and it's fun
- **mathematics** - the mother of science
- **physics** - the mother<sup>2</sup> of science

Setup:

- **OS**: Arch Linux x86_64
- **Kernel**: 6.\*.\*-arch1-1
- **CPU**: Intel Core i9-9900k ~~(with all vulnerabilities)~~
- **GPU**: AMD Radeon RX 570 (8 GB of VRAM)
- **Memory**: 16 GB
- **Shell**: Fish
- **Terminal**: Wezterm
- **Favourite multitools**: C, C++, Rust
- **Editor**: Neovim
